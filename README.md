# Hi, I'm Luka Moulin! 👋

I’m an IT student in my second year at IUT Robert Schuman, pursuing a BUT in Computer Science 💻. So far, I’ve had the opportunity to learn and work with:

- C
- C#
- JavaScript
- HTML
- PHP
- SQL
- Windows Forms

## Projects

I've had the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects, which have allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical way. Here are the most notable :

Sportipal : A project way back from Highschool where we had to design an app around the general theme of sports. We chose to design our app as a workout companion, giving tips of what exercises to do depending on which muscles you want to work on, and could even time how many pushups you could do in a minute using the built in camera! We were even able to enter in a competition.
