# 🇺🇸 Hi, I'm Luka Alexandre Moulin! 👋


I’m an IT student in my second year at IUT Robert Schuman, pursuing a BUT in Computer Science, specifically "BUT Informatique – parcours Développement et Réalisation d’Applications"  💻. 

## Skills :

Across my studies, I've been able to learn a multitude of programming languages, whether they be for application developement, web developement or data management. The languages I am most familiar with or as follow

### Fully Independent Use 🥇:
Languages that I can use and understand intuitively : 
- C
- C#
- Java

### Semi-Independent Use 🥈:
Languages that I am practiced in, but may still need to consult documents or examples :
- SQL/SQLite (Oracle)
- PHP

### Assisted Understanding 🥉:
Languages that I understand, but wouldn't be confident in using without some guidance :
- HTML 5
- Windows Forms

Outside of coding, I am also a fluent speaker and writer in both French and English!

## Hobies :

Being an IT student, I'm not the sportiest person around... 😅

However, I have been learning Fudokan Karate-Do for 3 years, and I am currently a blue belt!
I've also been in a few different clubs, including Swimming, Basketball and Soccer.

Outside of sports, I am a true gamer (the kind that doesn't shower). I've played many games, of course, of which my favorites would be:
- Team Fortress 2 🥪
- Red Dead Redemption 2 🤠
- Detroit: Become Human 🤖
- Blade & Sorcery ⚔
- H3VR 🌭
- Scrap Mechanic 🔧
- Satisfactory 🏭
- Fallout 4 ☢
- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 🧙‍♂️

(Yes, there are a lot, and these are just my favorites!)

## Projects

I've had the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects, which have allowed me to apply what i've learned throughout my studies in a practical, and often fun, way. Here are the most notable :

Sportipal : A project back from Highschool where we had to design an app around the general theme of sports. We chose to design our app as a workout companion, giving tips of what exercises to do depending on which muscles you want to work on, and could even time how many pushups you could do in a minute using the built in camera! We were even able to enter in a competition.
