# Hi, I'm Luka Alexandre Moulin! 👋

I’m an IT student in my second year at **IUT Robert Schuman**, pursuing a BUT in Computer Science, specifically **"BUT Informatique – parcours Développement et Réalisation d’Applications"**. 💻

## Skills :

Across my studies, I've been able to learn a multitude of programming languages, whether they be for application development, web development, or data management. The languages I am most familiar with are:

I've also been able to use multiple different frameworks and software, such as:

Outside of coding, I am also a **fluent speaker and writer in both French and English**!

## **Hobbies** :

Being an IT student, I'm not the sportiest person around... 😅

However, I have been learning **Fudokan Karate-Do** for 3 years, and I am currently a **blue belt**!
I've also been in a few different clubs, including swimming, basketball, and soccer.

Outside of sports, I am a true gamer (the kind that doesn't shower). I've played many games, of course, and my favorites would be:

* Team Fortress 2 🥪
* Red Dead Redemption 2 🤠
* Blade & Sorcery ⚔
* Fallout 4 ☢
* The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 🧙‍♂️

(There are many more, of course, but these are the ones that I've probably played the most!)

## Projects

I've had the opportunity to work on a multitude of projects, which have allowed me to apply what I've learned throughout my studies in a practical, and often fun, way. Here are the most notable:

---

**Sportipal** : A project back from high school where we had to design an app around the general theme of sports. We chose to design our app as a workout companion which could tell you what exercises to do depending on which muscles you want to work, and could even time how many pushups you could do in a minute using the built-in camera!

---

**DOOnjon's and Dragons** : A Java project where we recreated a simplified version of the well-known Dungeons & Dragons board game! The player would be able to create their own character, including class and race selection, then fight alongside their party members against monsters in a randomly generated dungeon, using weapons and spells!

---

**Firehouse** : A project where a small team and I had to design a Windows Forms application themed around a fire department, offering a multitude of services. Using an integrated database, the user could allocate firefighters to missions automatically based on their availability and skills, retrieve information on the different vehicles assigned to the various departments, and more!

---

**T3 – Educational Game** : A much more involved project, still ongoing, which consists of designing a serious, educational game that teaches the player about a subject assigned to our group. The instructions were purposefully vague, forcing us to manage our work autonomously and efficiently, simulating a true professional setting.
